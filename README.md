Principles and values of open spaces project

    "PublicSpaces provides a public network diverse and global XviewX of the world, 
    
    PublicSpaces serves the public good, and does not seek profit, now or ever and is indepdendent from any state. 
   
    connects people through media, 
    
    and has the public values of openness, transparency, accountability and XdemocracyX built in its DNA. 
    
    PublicSpaces serves the public good, and does not seek profit, now or ever and operates indepdendent from any state. 
    
    Openness: network is accessible to anyone, with interoperable platforms
    Transparency: fully accessible technology and full provenance of content
    Accountability: verified users and full data control
    
    It will be technically impossible to not fulfill PublicSpaces' guarantees to its users: 

    	• their data are safe and can never be provided to third parties
    	• they will always have complete access to and control over all their data
    	• their data will never be used for anything else than advertised, which is the operation of the service
    	• no other data than strictly necessary for the operation will be gathered and stored
    	• they will always have complete control over the content they get to see
    	• the origin of the content will always be guaranteed through a type of 'appellation controlée' or a certificate of origin, thus making it a lot harder for fake news to emerge
    	• not one single party will ever have complete control over the interface, the user experience or the administration of PublicSpaces
    	• PublicSpaces serves no political or commercial goal other than is stated in the public record for all to see.

        PublicSpaces is open for all registered users. A minimal amount of usage will be free, but PublicSpaces will in principle be a subscription based service; however, the fee will not be a huge obstacle for participation, rather a reminder that high-quality information comes at a cost. Also, the fee will be one of the deterrences built into the system for trolls looking for easy money."
